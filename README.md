# My_Gohugo
Project for a duration of 2 weeks using the HUGO framework (https://gohugo.io/).

Creation of a “Hugo” theme for town halls. This theme, once integrated into a static site, allow them to :
- Post upcoming events in the city
- Have a list of associations in the city
- Have a list of municipal council members
- Have a contact page

Launch a server using the following command (you must be at the root of the project) :
`hugo server -D`
